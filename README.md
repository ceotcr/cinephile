# ðŸŽ¥ Cinephile Bot ðŸŽ­

> A Telegram bot that notifies me of upcoming anime episodes â€” so I never miss a release again.

---

## ðŸ§  Background

July 2025 is huge for anime.

Multiple fan-favorite shows are returning with new seasons, and a bunch of exciting originals are premiering. I knew it would be hard to keep track of all the release dates â€” especially with shows airing in different time zones and platforms.

So, I built this.

## ðŸ”” What it Does

This is my **personal Telegram bot** built with **NestJS** that:

- Lets me `/add` an anime
- Sends a **daily notification** of whatâ€™s airing today
- Reminds me **5 minutes before each new episode drops**
- Updates itself with the next airing date (via Simkl API)
- Lets me manage my watchlist easily from Telegram
